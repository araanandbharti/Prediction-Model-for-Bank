# Prediction-Model-for-Bank
In thid ptoject I created a model for bank which is going to predict if its customer is able to return back its loan money or not.
I extracted data from https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/loan_train.csv in form of csv file and perform data cleaning, transformation and visulization using different tools and analyse it before feeding into my model. My model got accuracy around 85%.

I used different Machine learning classifier, these are
### 1. K Nearest Neighbor
### 2. Decision Tree
### 3. Support Vector Machine
### 4. Logistic Regression
